# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MEC Inference Routing System is an intelligent multi-agent platform that dynamically routes AI inference requests to the optimal compute location (device, edge, or cloud) based on real-time conditions, model requirements, and user context. The system optimizes for latency, accuracy, cost, and availability while providing autonomous decision-making capabilities.

This system is designed to meet AWS AI Agent qualification requirements by implementing reasoning LLMs for decision-making, demonstrating autonomous capabilities, and integrating with external APIs, databases, and tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating AI capabilities, I want the system to automatically route my inference requests to the best available compute tier, so that I get optimal performance without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN processing complex analysis THEN the system SHALL route to cloud models for maximum accuracy
3. WHEN processing regional data THEN the system SHALL prefer edge computing for optimal latency
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL prioritize local processing capabilities
5. IF user context indicates urgency THEN the system SHALL optimize for latency over cost

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy and manage the system using infrastructure as code, so that I can maintain consistent environments and easily scale the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all AWS resources SHALL be provisioned via CDK/CloudFormation scripts
2. WHEN updating infrastructure THEN changes SHALL be version controlled and reproducible
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through configuration
4. WHEN monitoring is required THEN all metrics SHALL be automatically configured in CloudWatch
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the multi-agent system to coordinate seamlessly and make autonomous decisions, so that the system operates reliably without constant human intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use standardized message formats and protocols
2. WHEN making decisions THEN agents SHALL coordinate to avoid conflicts and optimize globally
3. WHEN learning from performance data THEN the system SHALL automatically improve routing decisions
4. WHEN handling failures THEN agents SHALL implement graceful degradation and recovery
5. IF agent coordination fails THEN the system SHALL maintain basic functionality with reduced capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to handle data privacy and security appropriately across all compute tiers, so that we meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL prefer local/edge processing over cloud
2. WHEN data must be transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encryption and secure protocols
3. WHEN storing model metadata THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls
4. WHEN logging decisions THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information from logs
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately isolate affected components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want comprehensive analytics and learning capabilities, so that the system continuously improves its routing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting performance data THEN the system SHALL track latency, accuracy, cost, and availability metrics
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL identify optimization opportunities automatically
3. WHEN learning from decisions THEN the system SHALL update routing algorithms based on outcomes
4. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improvement
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically investigate and suggest corrections

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a competition participant, I want the system to meet all AWS AI Agent qualification criteria, so that the submission is eligible and demonstrates required capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying LLMs THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI as the hosting platform
2. WHEN implementing core functionality THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock AgentCore primitives for agent coordination
3. WHEN making routing decisions THEN the system SHALL use reasoning LLMs (Nova/Claude) for decision-making logic
4. WHEN operating autonomously THEN the system SHALL demonstrate task execution with and without human inputs
5. WHEN integrating external systems THEN the system SHALL connect to APIs, databases, and monitoring tools
6. IF additional services are needed THEN the system MAY use AWS Lambda, S3, and API Gateway as helper services

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the multi-agent system to use AWS-native services for agent coordination and communication, so that we leverage cloud-native capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
