# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EdgeMind is a 5G-MEC intelligence orchestration system that deploys Strands agent swarms directly at Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) sites near 5G RAN controllers. The system enables real-time AI orchestration through threshold-based monitoring and autonomous swarm coordination, ensuring sub-100ms decision making without cloud dependency for time-critical applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Threshold-Based Orchestration

**User Story:** As a MEC operator, I want the system to automatically monitor performance thresholds and trigger swarm responses, so that real-time applications maintain sub-100ms latency without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN latency exceeds 100ms THEN the Orchestrator Agent SHALL trigger swarm coordination within 10ms
2. WHEN CPU/GPU load exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL activate load balancing across available MEC sites
3. WHEN queue depth exceeds 50 requests THEN the swarm SHALL redistribute workload to alternate MEC sites
4. WHEN network conditions degrade THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust thresholds to maintain performance
5. WHEN all thresholds are within normal ranges THEN the system SHALL operate in autonomous mode without cloud involvement

### Requirement 2: Strands Agent Swarm Coordination

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want Strands agents to coordinate as a swarm across multiple MEC sites, so that load balancing and decision making happens autonomously at the edge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a swarm trigger occurs THEN all relevant Strands agents SHALL coordinate within 50ms
2. WHEN MEC sites communicate THEN the system SHALL use direct MEC-to-MEC networking without cloud routing
3. WHEN making load balancing decisions THEN the swarm SHALL reach consensus using distributed algorithms
4. WHEN a MEC site fails THEN the swarm SHALL automatically failover to healthy sites within 100ms
5. WHEN swarm coordination completes THEN the system SHALL log decisions for pattern learning

### Requirement 3: Device Layer Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile application developer, I want device-level Small Language Models (SLMs) to handle immediate responses and trigger MEC processing when needed, so that users get instant feedback for simple queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user request is simple THEN the device SLM SHALL respond within 50ms without MEC involvement
2. WHEN request complexity exceeds device capabilities THEN the SLM SHALL trigger MEC orchestration within 10ms
3. WHEN device battery is low THEN the system SHALL prefer lMEC processing to conserve power
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the device SHALL operate offline with cached responses
5. WHEN MEC processing completes THEN the device SHALL receive the response within the total 100ms target

### Requirement 4: MEC Site Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a telecom infrastructure manager, I want MEC sites to operate autonomously with containerized Strands agents, so that real-time decisions happen at the network edge near RAN controllers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying agents THEN the system SHALL use containerized deployment with Docker/Kubernetes
2. WHEN MEC sites communicate THEN the latency SHALL be under 20ms between adjacent sites
3. WHEN local caching is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain 15-minute refresh cycles with predictive preloading
4. WHEN MEC capacity changes THEN the system SHALL automatically scale containers based on demand
5. WHEN MEC sites are deployed THEN they SHALL be physically located within 10ms round-trip latency

### Requirement 5: Cloud Observer Role

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cloud to serve as a passive observer for analytics and monitoring, so that long-term insights are available without interfering with real-time edge decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the cloud SHALL aggregate data from MEC sites without real-time decision making
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the cloud SHALL provide insights for threshold optimization but not override edge decisions
3. WHEN storing historical data THEN the cloud SHALL maintain compliance with data residency requirements
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the cloud SHALL provide observability dashboards for system performance
5. WHEN MEC sites are autonomous THEN the cloud SHALL NOT be required for operational decisions

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Performance

**User Story:** As an application developer building time-critical applications, I want guaranteed sub-100ms response times for orchestration decisions, so that autonomous vehicles, gaming, and industrial control systems can operate safely (for simulated workloads).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any request THEN the total orchestration decision time SHALL be under 100ms
2. WHEN measuring latency THEN 95% of decisions SHALL complete within 80ms
3. WHEN system load increases THEN performance SHALL degrade gracefully without exceeding 150ms
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent sub-100ms performance
5. WHEN benchmarking performance THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 50% faster response than cloud-dependent alternatives

### Requirement 7: Swarm Intelligence and Learning

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the agent swarm to learn from performance patterns and optimize thresholds automatically, so that the system improves over time without manual tuning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decisions are made THEN the Decision Coordinator Agent SHALL log outcomes for pattern analysis
2. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust thresholds to optimize performance
3. WHEN anomalies occur THEN the swarm SHALL adapt coordination strategies to maintain service quality
4. WHEN learning from historical data THEN the system SHALL predict and preload resources based on usage patterns
5. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL implement improvements autonomously

### Requirement 8: Fault Tolerance and Resilience

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want the system to maintain 99.9% availability through automatic failover and graceful degradation, so that critical applications continue operating even during component failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a MEC site fails THEN the swarm SHALL redirect traffic to healthy sites within 100ms
2. WHEN network partitions occur THEN isolated MEC sites SHALL continue operating with cached data
3. WHEN agent failures happen THEN the system SHALL restart failed agents automatically within 30 seconds
4. WHEN cascading failures are detected THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent system-wide outages
5. WHEN recovering from failures THEN the system SHALL gradually restore traffic to recovered components

### Requirement 9: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the system to maintain data privacy and security at the edge while complying with regional regulations, so that sensitive data processing meets enterprise security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL keep data local to the appropriate geographic region
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN all inter-MEC communication SHALL be encrypted in transit
3. WHEN storing data locally THEN MEC sites SHALL implement encryption at rest for cached models and responses
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL log all orchestration decisions with timestamps and rationale
5. WHEN compliance is verified THEN the system SHALL support GDPR, HIPAA, and other regional privacy regulations

### Requirement 10: Containerized Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Strands agents deployed in containers with proper orchestration, so that the system can scale dynamically and maintain consistent deployment across MEC sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying agents THEN each Strands agent SHALL run in its own container with resource limits
2. WHEN scaling is needed THEN Kubernetes SHALL automatically scale agent containers based on load metrics
3. WHEN updating agents THEN the system SHALL support rolling updates without service interruption
4. WHEN monitoring containers THEN health checks SHALL detect and restart failed agent containers within 10 seconds
5. WHEN managing resources THEN container orchestration SHALL optimize CPU/GPU allocation across agents

### Requirement 11: Demo and Visualization

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a real-time dashboard that demonstrates MEC orchestration and swarm coordination in action, so that the system's capabilities and performance can be clearly understood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN the dashboard SHALL show real-time threshold monitoring with live metrics
2. WHEN visualizing swarm coordination THEN the interface SHALL display agent communication and consensus decisions
3. WHEN showing performance THEN the dashboard SHALL compare MEC response times against cloud-dependent alternatives
