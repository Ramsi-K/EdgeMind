# MEC Inference Routing System - Architecture Verification

## ✅ Project Foundation Verification Complete

### Architecture Understanding Confirmed

**✅ Agents = Lambda Functions with Strands**
- Agents are deployed as AWS Lambda functions using Docker containers
- Each agent uses Strands framework with BedrockModel for Nova reasoning
- Agent state is persisted in S3 between invocations for conversation continuity

**✅ Tools = @tool Decorators Calling AWS Services**
- Tools are Python functions decorated with `@tool` from Strands
- Tools call AWS services directly using boto3 (DynamoDB, Bedrock, S3, etc.)
- No MCP servers in production - direct AWS API integration

**✅ MCP Servers = Local Development Only**
- MCP servers are used for local development and testing
- Production deployment uses direct AWS service calls via boto3
- This explains the $100 budget - for actual AWS service usage

### Key Components Verified

**✅ Strands Agent (cdk/lambda/app.py)**
- Uses `from strands import Agent, tool`
- Uses `from strands.models import BedrockModel`
- Implements tools with `@tool` decorator
- Calls AWS services via boto3
- Persists state in S3 for conversation continuity

**✅ Lambda Deployment (cdk/lambda/)**
- Dockerfile uses `public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.13`
- Requirements include `strands-agents` and `strands-agents-tools`
- Handler function follows Lambda signature: `handler(event, context)`

**✅ CDK Infrastructure**
- TypeScript-based CDK following AWS best practices
- Will deploy Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, IAM roles
- Follows pattern from Strands samples repository

### Deployment Flow Confirmed

1. **Development**: Use MCP servers locally for testing
2. **Production**: Deploy Strands agents as Lambda functions
3. **Runtime**: Agents call AWS services directly (Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3)
4. **Cost**: $100 budget covers Bedrock model calls, Lambda execution, storage

### Next Steps

- Task 2: Implement data models and dummy data generation
- Task 3: Create TypeScript CDK stack for infrastructure
- Task 4: Implement individual agent logic with proper tools
- Task 5: Deploy and test the complete system

## Architecture Clarity Achieved ✅

The confusion between MCP servers and production deployment is now resolved. We're building:
- **Strands Agents** deployed as **Lambda functions**
- **Tools** that call **AWS services directly**
- **MCP servers** for **local development only**

This matches the official Strands deployment tutorial pattern and explains the AWS budget allocation.
