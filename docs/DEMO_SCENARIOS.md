**MEC Orchestration Decision**:
1. **Device SLM**: Processes simple dialogue → "Basic response ready (40ms)"
2. **Orchestrator**: Detects complexity threshold exceeded → "Trigger swarm coordination"
3. **Swarm Coordination**: Tokyo MEC A + MEC B collaborate → "Load balanced processing"
4. **Result**: 85ms response with rich, contextual lore through MEC intelligence

**Comparison Shown**:
- Device only: 40ms but generic response
- Cloud dependency: 2s+ with network delays
- **MEC swarm coordination: 85ms with intelligent response** ✅

### Business Impact
- 60% faster than cloud
- 3x richer than device
- Player engagement +40%

**Dashboard Shows**:
- Patient vitals: Heart rate spike detected
- Privacy level: HIPAA compliance required
- Network: Hospital WiFi (reliable but regulated)

**Tiered Response**:
1. **Critical Alert (Device)**: Heart rate >120 BPM → Immediate nurse alert (50ms)
2. **Pattern Analysis (MEC)**: Regional health data → Trend analysis (200ms)
3. **Diagnostic Support (Cloud)**: Medical literature → Treatment recommendations (3s)

**Privacy Protection**:
- Raw vitals stay on device
- Anonymized patterns to MEC
- Aggregated insights to cloud

### Business Impact
- 50% faster emergency response
- HIPAA compliance maintained
- 30% better diagnostic accuracy

**Dashboard Shows**:
- Equipment: Conveyor belt motor
- Sensor data: Vibration anomaly detected
- Network: Industrial ethernet (stable, low bandwidth)

**Predictive Pipeline**:
1. **Anomaly Detection (Device)**: Vibration threshold exceeded → Immediate alert (100ms)
2. **Failure Prediction (MEC)**: Historical patterns → 6-hour failure prediction (500ms)
3. **Maintenance Optimization (Cloud)**: Supply chain + scheduling → Optimal maintenance window (5s)

**Cost Optimization**:
- Prevent $50K equipment failure
- Schedule maintenance during planned downtime
- Optimize parts inventory

### Business Impact
- 99.9% uptime maintained
- 40% maintenance cost reduction
- $10M annual savings

## 🛒 Scenario 5: Retail - Personalized Shopping

### Setup
**Store**: Smart retail with AR shopping assistant
**Challenge**: Instant product recognition with personalized recommendations

### Demo Flow (20 seconds)

**Dashboard Shows**:
- Customer: Scanning product with phone
- Request: "Find similar items in my size and budget"
- Location: In-store with store WiFi

**Smart Routing**:
1. **Product Recognition (Device)**: Camera → Product ID (100ms)
2. **Inventory Check (MEC)**: Store inventory → Available options (200ms)
3. **Personalization (Cloud)**: Purchase history → Personalized recommendations (1s)

**Result**: Seamless shopping experience with instant recognition and smart recommendations
