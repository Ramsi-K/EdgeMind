# MEC Intelligence Orchestration - Technical Architecture

## 🏗️ System Overview

EdgeMind deploys Strands agent swarms directly at MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) sites near 5G RAN controllers. The system uses threshold-based orchestration to trigger intelligent load balancing across MEC sites, ensuring optimal performance without cloud dependency.

## 🤖 MEC Agent Architecture

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
**Purpose**: Monitors system thresholds and triggers swarm coordination

**Responsibilities**:
- Latency threshold monitoring (<100ms target)
- CPU/GPU load tracking across MEC sites
- Queue depth analysis
- Swarm trigger decisions

**Deployment**: Primary controller at each MEC site

**Key Algorithms**:
```python
def monitor_thresholds(mec_metrics):
    # Monitor latency, CPU, GPU, queue depth
    # Trigger swarm when thresholds exceeded
    if any_threshold_breached(mec_metrics):
        trigger_swarm_coordination()
    return orchestration_decision

def trigger_swarm_coordination():
    # Activate Strands agents across MEC sites
    # Coordinate load balancing decisions
    # Ensure sub-100ms response times
    return swarm_activation_plan
```

### 2. Resource Monitor Agent
**Purpose**: Tracks real-time metrics across MEC infrastructure

**Responsibilities**:
- MEC site capacity monitoring
- Network latency between MEC sites
- Device connectivity status
- Local cache performance

**Deployment**: Strands swarm member at each MEC site

**Metrics Tracked**:
- CPU/GPU utilization per MEC site
- Memory usage and availability
- Inter-MEC network latency
- Device-to-MEC connection quality
- Local inference queue depths

### 3. Load Balancer Agent
**Purpose**: Distributes workload across MEC sites in real-time

**Responsibilities**:
- Dynamic load distribution
- MEC site selection
- Failover coordination
- Performance optimization

**Decision Matrix**:
```
Priority Factors:
1. MEC site latency (50%)
2. Current load capacity (30%)
3. Network proximity (15%)
4. Site availability (5%)
```

**Load Balancing Logic**:
```python
def balance_mec_load(swarm_metrics, incoming_request):
    mec_scores = {}
    for site in available_mec_sites:
        mec_scores[site] = calculate_mec_score(
            latency=site.current_latency,
            capacity=site.available_capacity,
            proximity=site.network_distance
        )
    return select_optimal_mec_site(mec_scores)
```

### 4. Cache Manager Agent
**Purpose**: Manages local caching and model deployment at MEC sites

**Responsibilities**:
- Local model caching (15-minute refresh cycles)
- Response caching for frequent queries
- Model version synchronization
- Predictive preloading

**Deployment**: Strands swarm member with local storage access

**Caching Strategy**:
- **Hot models**: Permanently cached at MEC sites
- **Warm models**: Cached based on usage patterns
- **Response cache**: 15-minute TTL for frequent queries
- **Predictive loading**: Based on swarm coordination signals

### 5. Decision Coordinator Agent
**Purpose**: Coordinates swarm consensus and learning

**Responsibilities**:
- Swarm decision consensus
- Performance pattern recognition
- Threshold adjustment
- Anomaly detection and response

**Deployment**: Strands swarm coordinator with inter-MEC communication

**Coordination Logic**:
- Aggregates decisions from multiple MEC sites
- Learns from performance patterns
- Adjusts thresholds based on network conditions
- Coordinates failover between MEC sites
